		<h1>On Life as an Extension of Experience</h1>
		<p>I see the world as a series of interconnected systems.</p>
		<p>“Systems” here is rather general; they can be of any size, shape, or purpose. Most, if not all, however, do serve some purpose.</p>
		<p>Thinking in systems the way I do necessitates that I pay attention to a certain subset of information. I tend to see individual things as building blocks of something else. Everything is, in a general sense, a part of something else—another cog in the system.</p>
		<p>Naturally, seeing the world in this way, you begin to identify a pyramid-like structure of “things” in general.</p>
		<h2>The Pyramid of Complexity</h2>
		<p>Imagine the construction of a pyramid.</p>
		<p>You begin by creating a very large, very stable foundation. The initial building block. The layout, size, and position of all other blocks are dictated by the attributes of the base.</p>
		<p>Like a real pyramid, though, each new block/level is smaller than the one below it.</p>
		<p>In other words, every other part of it is only a subset of the previous one. A subset, in this context, can be thought of as an <strong>abstraction</strong> of the previous block. It is smaller and easier to work with.</p>
		<p>It can be said, then, that the pyramid increasingly becomes less complex as it becomes taller.</p>
		<p>Or in other words, it becomes more complex the further you go down.</p>
		<h3>A Side-Note on Simplicity</h3>
		<p>If you apply this pyramid metaphor to a few other concepts, you may start to notice that the simplicity of deeper concepts is more apparent than the ones at the top.</p>
		<p>I have no better example than to use the topic of this article itself.</p>
		<p>The general concept of “life” is probably, on average, more complex than the concept of, say, “experience” to most people. Naturally, of course, this is subject to both interpretation and subjectivity.</p>
		<h2>The Building Blocks of Experience</h2>
		<p>For many years, I’ve sometimes thought about what it would “feel” like to live with no senses.</p>
		<p>Imagine: your sense of sight, smell, touch, taste, and sound are ripped away from you.</p>
		<p>I ask you, then, what do you have to go on? To interpret your reality, I mean.</p>
		<p>If I understand my bedroom as a box of a particular shape and size, if I suddenly lose my ability to gauge that, my whole perspective and interpretation of the room is destroyed.</p>
		<p>This is even apparent, to some degree, when you cover one of your eyes. Your depth perception is severely reduced, and your overall visual perspective of reality changes.</p>
		<p>It is then clear that your entire perspective of reality is entirely within your head.</p>
		<p>I ask you, then, is “life” as a general concept of existence not based upon experience itself?</p>
		<p>Would “life” exist without experience?</p>
		<p>If not, then how can it <strong>not</strong> be built upon, at least in one fashion or another, on experience itself, on our senses?</p>
		<p>And if so, where, then, does experience lie upon the pyramid of our reality? Is life the entire pyramid?</p>
		<p>Surely, something is based upon something else. If I can alter my perspective of reality by closing a single eye, by making a physical change, then surely experience must rest upon something much more complex.</p>
		<h2>My Opinion</h2>
		<p>I generally attempt to merely pose a question with these kinds of articles. Food for thought.</p>
		<p>Philosophy is largely, however, just that. Of course, it it much more complex than it appears; philosophic perspectives have led to some amazing innovations. They do, indeed, have utility, if applied correctly.</p>
		<p>Regardless of the supposed utility of this point, I believe that “life” as a concept is a simple one. It is, however, based upon experience in some form or another.</p>
		<p>This of course begs the question, “what is experience based on?”</p>
		<p>I do not know. Perhaps I will hypothesize, given time.</p>
		<p>Think about it.</p>
		<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
